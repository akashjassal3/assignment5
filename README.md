# Assignment 5

## Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems Assignment

## Overview
This assignment serves as a practical exploration into the realm of collaborative filtering recommender systems, which are central to delivering personalized recommendations across various platforms. It is designed to offer a hands-on approach to building, implementing, and assessing recommender systems, leveraging a dataset of movie ratings for practical exercises.

## Objectives
1. Gain a solid understanding of collaborative filtering's core principles.
2. Acquire skills in handling and analyzing a movie ratings dataset.
3. Develop and code collaborative filtering algorithms from the ground up.
4. Measure and interpret the effectiveness of the built recommender systems.

## Requirements
1. **Packages**: Ensure the installation of all necessary Python packages as outlined in the notebook. These are essential for effective data handling, analysis, and visual representation throughout the assignment.

2. **Dataset**: The assignment employs a dataset comprising movie ratings to illustrate the functionality of collaborative filtering algorithms. The notebook provides comprehensive instructions on dataset loading and preprocessing steps.

## Usage
The notebook is carefully organized to navigate you through the critical elements and technical intricacies of collaborative filtering recommender systems. It is segmented into various sections, each dedicated to a distinct facet of recommender systems. Starting from collaborative filtering fundamentals, it extends to practical implementations with a movie ratings dataset.

You will encounter exercises and tasks within each section, challenging you to either write new code or scrutinize existing code to achieve the specified objectives.
